# epuppy - terminal epub reader

This is a little TUI epub ebook reader. This is a work in progress and
may not work for all EPUB files yet. It uses a modified version of the
[epub module](https://github.com/kapmahc/epub/), which seems to be
unmaintained but the best I could find to parse EPUBs. Find it in the
`pkg/epub/` directory.

## Installation

### Installation from source

Check out the repository and execute `go build`, then copy the
compiled binary to your `$PATH`.
