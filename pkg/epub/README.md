# epub module

This is a modified version of the [epub
module](https://github.com/kapmahc/epub/). I fixed a couple of issues
and I added code to retrieve the actual epub content, which the
original module doesn't implement. Since the last update on that
module was 9 years ago (as I write this), it doesn't make sense to
send a PR. And it also makes no sense to me to publish it separately.


# ORIGINAL README

## epub
A pure go implementation of epub file format.
